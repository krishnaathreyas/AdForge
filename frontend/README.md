### üìÇ Project Structure

The code within the `lib/` directory is organized to follow clean architecture principles:

* **`main.dart`**: The entry point of the application and the main navigation shell.
* **`models/`**: Contains the `Product` data model.
* **`providers/`**: Contains the `AppProvider`, which acts as the central "brain" for all state management.
* **`screens/`**: Contains the UI code for each of the four main screens (Home, Scan, Context, Results).
* **`services/`**: Contains the `ApiService`, which handles all communication with the backend.
* **`theme/`**: Contains the `AppTheme` file for a centralized, professional look and feel.
